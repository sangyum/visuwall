/**
 * A handle which represents a connection between two end-points regardless of transport types.
 * <p/>
 * {@link IoSession} provides user-defined attributes. User-defined attributes are application-specific data which are
 * associated with a session. It often contains objects that represents the state of a higher-level protocol and becomes
 * a way to exchange data between filters and handlers.
 * <p/>
 * <h3>Adjusting Transport Type Specific Properties</h3>
 * <p/>
 * You can simply downcast the session to an appropriate subclass.
 * </p>
 * <p/>
 * <h3>Thread Safety</h3>
 * <p/>
 * {@link IoSession} is thread-safe. But please note that performing more than one {@link #write(Object)} calls at the
 * same time will cause the {@link IoFilter#filterWrite(IoFilter.NextFilter,IoSession,WriteRequest)} to be executed
 * simultaneously, and therefore you have to make sure the {@link IoFilter} implementations you're using are
 * thread-safe, too.
